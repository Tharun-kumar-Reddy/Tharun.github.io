    <font color="orange"><h2>Description</h2></font>
    <ul>
        
    <font size="4"><li>we eliminate the traditional cloud or third-party storage problems by storing the IoT data on a decentralized storage system known as IPFS, which combines with the Ethereum blockchain.</li>

        <li>DO set an access control policy so that unauthorized personnel cannot control or view data.</li>
        <li>We introduce attribute-based access control (A-BAC) and AES-128 encryption schemes for better data security and privacy that encrypt the IoT stream before uploading to IPFS.</li>
        
        <li>Furthermore, the encrypted hashes are stored in the Ethereum smart contract. Moreover, the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol is used to securely distribute the secret key that solves the problem of key management; in our solution, a trustworthy PKG (private key generator) is not required.</li>
        <li> Whenever a data user forgets his private key, he can only access the transaction details from the Ethereum blockchain and get the private key.</li>
        
        <li>IoTChain is an incentive-based approach. The nodes that store the data will be rewarded with digital currency. </li><li>Filecoin, a digital currency introduced by IPFS, will be rewarded as an incentive to encourage the storage nodes. </li><li>Furthermore, smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to implement encrypted keyword searches in the IPFS.</li>
        
       <li>In the IoTChain model, the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism is replaced with a proof-of-authority (PoA) to minimize transaction cost and boost system throughput.</li><li>Additionally, the smart contracts will operate in good faith and as per their logic.</li>
        
        <li>We simulated our scheme via Ethereum official test network Rinkeby, and the corresponding performance and transaction cost were analyzed. </li></font></ul>
